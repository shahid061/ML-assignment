# Review on the blog [Paths to Equilibrium in Games | NeurIPS 2024](https://mahabhu.github.io/CSE471_assignment/)

## Blog Summary

The blog provides a breakdown of the paper [Paths to Equilibrium in Games](https://openreview.net/forum?id=LxxIiInmuF), presented at NeurIPS 2024. It improves accessibility to people with less technical backgrounds by providing simple, easy to understand explanations of complex concepts and rigorous mathematical theories. Starting off with definitions of concepts used in the paper, the authors continue on to lay out the mathematical framework used in the proof before explaining the proof in natural language. They go on to highlight the implications of the proof and how it can be extended to other branches of game theory. And lastly they show the rigorous mathematical proofs of the theorems and lemmas in the paper while providing step-by-step explanations alongside mathematical notaion making it easier to follow.

## Strengths

- **Clarity and Structure:**

  The blog is well structured. The introduction clearly lays out the problem statement, before following up with definitions of concepts used in the paper and laying out the proof. Followed by insights gained from the proof and possible applications.

- **Accessibility:**

  The blog does an exceptional job of explaining complex concepts, thus improving accessibility to people from less techincal backgrounds. Simplifying game-theory concepts like Nash equilibrium, normal-form games, and satisficing paths makes the content digestible. And the rock-paper-scissors example helps readers grasp abstract ideas. Explanations of the step-by-step proofs of the theorem and lemmas also makes them easier to follow.

- **Relevance and Insights:**

  The paper highlights key insights, particularly the counterintuitive insight of using sub-optimal updates. The inclusion of practical implications for MARL and applications on markov games and decentralized systems adds depth and relevance.

## Criticisms

While the blog is very well written from a technical standpoint, it was not particularly engaging for the reader and may be found uninteresting if the reader was not already curious about the subject matter. A lack of visual elements also adds to this.

## Conclusion

The authors of the blog have done an excellent job simplifying and contextualizing a dense technical paper. Inspite of the minor criticisms, the blog can appeal to a wide audience and serve as an entry point into complex game-theory concepts for people new to the field.
